#### Author : Sudeshna Bora

### Stage 1 

This script will get all nse stocks.
Then it wil filter out the ones which are below 2000 [can be changed].

<b>Output:</b> I will use these stocks to leisurely keep on analysing. 
And buy if I find a good one.

<b>Step 1:</b> 
We will be using https://archives.nseindia.com/archives/equities/bhavcopy/pr/PR010421.zip to get the last price (Column LAST). 

Another nice place to get all scrips :
